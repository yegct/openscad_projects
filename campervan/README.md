# Medicine Cabinet Dividers for Pleasure Way 2022 Plateau TS

A clean-room reimplementation of a design based on [Acoles' model for the 2015.5 Pleasure Way TS](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4924552). This is based on my 2022 Pleasure Way Plateau TS. All of the dimensions are parameterised, so it should be easy to modify for any similar campervan medicine cabinet.

## How to Print

PLA should be fine but you can use PETg or whatever you like.

You'll want to print a total of twelve models, four for each row in the medicine cabinet. You want two or three separators per row. I therefore suggest printing six spacers and six separators to fill the entire medicine cabinet.

The models are oriented for printing. I print at a layer height of 0.20. Infill doesn't matter as these are thin models.
