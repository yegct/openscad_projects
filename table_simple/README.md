# Simple Table
A very simple parameterised table.

You can adjust the dimensions easily in [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/). You can print with or without a middle v-support. You can use this as the starting point for your own project.

## How to Print

* PLA for indoor use, ASA or PETg for outdoor use
* Layer height 0.20
* Infill 20%, higher if you want a bit more stability
* Cubic subdivision (or cubic or gyroid) for infill pattern

## How to Tweak
The design is parameterised. Open the file in OpenSCAD and take a look at the top. You can change the length, width, height, and thickness. You can choose to include the v-support structure or not.
